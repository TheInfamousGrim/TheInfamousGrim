- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheInfamousGrim
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, blockchain dev as well as some game dev in my spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of web development, Then gonna move on and learn some proper algorithms and data structures. Just joined a bootcamp at the University of Birmingham.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not sure yet. I wanna work with anyone doing anything with regards to blockchain technology.
I have an interest in the supply chain side management side of things as I believe these have actual value rather than NFTs in their current format.
- 📫 How to reach me: finchergeorge1@gmail.com
